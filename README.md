# Proxy-project

Hello everyone!

This project was made by me for fun and learning purpore mostly.
This tools allows to read incoming and sending packets from an online game.
And also it can exploit an old bug at the packet level wich allows you to create any item you want in a click.

I'll try to update the code to make it more clear because it was pretty hard to read at first.
I was still learning many things about networking, memory, APIs and so on.

I did not upload all the files, i just show a part of the source that show how the main logic behind the proxy works.
